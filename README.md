# Retail Shopping Application Backend

I have developed a robust backend for a retail shopping application using a microservice architecture, executed in Node.js. This architecture is divided into three primary services, each designed to handle specific aspects of the application.

## 1. Customer Service
This service is the backbone of all customer-related operations. It manages tasks such as customer registration, login, profile management, and more. The primary focus is to ensure a smooth user experience by facilitating user interactions with the application.

## 2. Shopping Service
The heart of the shopping functionality, this service manages the shopping cart, processes order placements, and tracks orders to ensure an efficient shopping experience. The goal is to make the shopping process as seamless and user-friendly as possible.

## 3. Product Service
The core of product management, this service takes care of product listings, provides detailed product information, and oversees inventory management. Its purpose is to ensure that the products are accurately represented and managed within the application.

To ensure seamless communication between these diverse services, I have implemented a message broker. This component plays a crucial role in the architecture, ensuring reliable and efficient communication between the microservices. It allows each service to operate independently while still coordinating effectively to perform complex tasks.

The message broker is the unsung hero of this architecture, operating behind the scenes to ensure that each service can communicate with the others. It helps maintain the independence of the services, reducing the risk of system-wide failures.

In addition to these services, the architecture also includes several other components. These include a database for storing user and product information, an API gateway for handling requests from the frontend, and a load balancer to ensure that the system can handle high levels of traffic.

## Database per Service Pattern
To scale the database, the Database per Service pattern is used. Each microservice has a dedicated database for independent data management, which can be distributed across multiple servers for better load balancing. However, it may introduce challenges such as data consistency across multiple databases.

## Components
- **Message Broker:** Ensures efficient communication between diverse services.
- **Database:** Stores user and product information.
- **API Gateway:** Handles requests from the frontend.
- **Load Balancer:** Ensures the system can handle high traffic levels.

## Pros and Cons of Microservice Architecture
### Pros
- Modularity
- Scalability
- Fault Isolation
- Independent Development

### Cons
- Increased Complexity
- Potential Data Management Issues
- Possible Latency in Inter-Service Communication
- Need for Sophisticated Deployment and Monitoring Tools
